# mini-project-2

## I had to copy the look of a picture mock up site.

```
This site needed to be viewable on a mobile device as well as a desktop. 
It needed easily identifiable headings.
The code on the page needed to be easily copied by clicking on it.
```
## Functionality

```
When you click on the code you're able to easily highlight it.
When you hover over the headers they have a transitional shadow.
When you hover over the sections holding code they also have a transitional shadow.
```
